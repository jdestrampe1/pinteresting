Worked through some gem file errors and version issues.
Updated the gem installer to -v 2.2.3 and it seems
	stable now.

ExecJs error fixed.

Installed gem coffee-script-source -v 1.8.0
Corrected spelling mistake in application.html.erb file
Bootstrap changes now taking effect.

Nav bar collapse working, but right side link button doesn't function when screen is resized. There is no response when button is clicked.
